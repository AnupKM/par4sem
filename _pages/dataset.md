The dataset we have collected as a use-case for ``Par4Sem`` are available [here]()
There are two two types of formats for the dataset.
1. __CSV file__: This file contains, for each iteration, the target, the ranking based on the **learning to rank** model, and the gold ranking as it is provided from the MTUrk workers. This file is used to train ranking models.
2. __Diff file__: This file shows, in an html format, the diff of the **original** text and the **simplified** file by the workers. This file can be used to train target word identification model.
