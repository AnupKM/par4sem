``Par4Sem`` can be installed in three different ways. While the first way allows to run only the frontend component from any web server (or even locally using a browser), the other two approach requires installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
1. **Minimal installation**:
    * Download the frontend zip file from [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/par4sem/)
    * Unzip the file and either 1) put the whole file in your web-server (such as apache) or 2) open the index.html file in your browser.
    * If you deploy the file in a webserver, access it with the context name (if you deploy the file under the folder par4Sem, access it as (<a href ="http://WEBADDRESS/par4sem">http://WEBADDRESS/par4sem</a>)
    * Voila you are done  ðŸ˜„Â  Â    Â Â 
1. **Complete local installation** Use resources and database dumps on local Machine.
      Follow this approach if you like to install the complete `Par4Sem` software in your local server.
      **Requirements**:  To run the whole application you need to fulfill the following:
      * [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
      * RAM ~4GB
      * Hard Disk: ~100GB (for different resources and database dumps)

      All the resource files such as phrase2vec embeddings, OpenNLP models for parts-of-speech tagging, tokenizations, and sentence splitting, Wikipedia frequency counts are available [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/resources/). Database dumps for the different paraphrase resources such as PPDB 2.0, JoBimText DT, WordNet, SimplePPDB and CWI datasets are available [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/database/).  [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/datasets/).
      To start ``Par4Sem``:
      *  Download the [docker-compose](https://github.com/uhh-lt/par4sem/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file.
      * Download the [database dump](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/database), unzip and put them under ``dumps`` folder
      * download the [resources file](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/par4sem/resources/), unzip and put them under ``data`` folder
      * start the docker as ``docker-compose up -d``


3. **From source code**
      * Clone the source code from GutHub: `git clone https://github.com/uhh-lt/par4sem.git`
      * run `mvn clean install` inside par4sem directory
      * copy the DockerFile, and the web/targte/par4sem.war file to a directory of your choice
      * Run `docker build -t par4sem . `
      * Follow Step two above but make sure to edit the docker-compose file to point to the new image you build.
